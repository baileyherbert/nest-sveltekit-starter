# Nest SvelteKit Starter

> [!CAUTION]
> This is an experimental template and is very much a work in progress. It's not suitable to be used for anything serious at this time.

This is a starter template that combines NestJS and SvelteKit into an [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) monorepo, and implements a common package that can be shared by both projects.
